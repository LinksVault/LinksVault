# Privacy Policy — LinksVault

Last updated: [REPLACE WITH DATE]

This Privacy Policy explains how LinksVault (“we”, “us”, or the “App”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use the LinksVault mobile application.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App. By using the App, you consent to the practices described here.

## 1. Data We Collect
We collect the following categories of data to provide core functionality and operate the service:

- Account Information: email address (via Firebase Authentication). If provided or synced, we may also store your display name and profile photo.
- Demographic Information you provide: name, age, gender (if you choose to provide these in your profile or they are part of your account data).
- User Content: links you save, collections you create, titles, descriptions, thumbnails and other related metadata (including timestamps).
- Device/Technical Data: device information, IP address, app version, diagnostics/crash logs, and analytics events (only if Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics are enabled in the app).

We do not collect payment information within the App unless explicitly stated in an additional section or update to this policy.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data to:

- Provide core features: save, sync, and display your links and collections across devices.
- Maintain and improve reliability, performance, and security of the service.
- Provide customer support and troubleshoot issues.
- Prevent, detect, and address abuse, spam, or violations of our terms.
- Improve the product and user experience (only if Analytics is enabled).

We do not sell personal data.

## 3. Legal Bases (where applicable)
Where required by law (e.g., GDPR), we process personal data based on:

- Performance of a contract (to provide the App’s core functionality).
- Legitimate interests (to maintain, secure, and improve the service, and to prevent abuse).
- Consent (for optional analytics or if you provide demographic information).

## 4. Storage, Processing, and Security
- We use Google Firebase as our backend service provider (Firestore, Authentication, and—if applicable—Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics). Your data may be processed and stored by Firebase under their security and privacy controls.
- All data is transmitted over encrypted (HTTPS) connections.
- We apply Firebase Security Rules and other safeguards to help protect your data.

## 5. Access to Your Data
- Your links and collections are private to your account by default.
- Certain stored data may be accessible to the developer strictly for technical support, debugging, security, or abuse prevention purposes. Access is limited and logged where feasible.
- We do not share personal data with third parties beyond our service providers necessary to operate the App (e.g., Firebase/Google).

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We rely on the following service provider(s):

- Google Firebase (Google LLC) — authentication, database, storage, crash reporting, and optional analytics. Data may be processed and stored by Firebase subject to their terms, security, and privacy commitments.

We do not sell personal data. We may disclose information if required by law, to respond to legal requests, or to protect our rights, users, or the public.

## 7. Data Retention
- Account and User Content data (links, collections, related metadata) are retained for as long as your account remains active.
- Diagnostic/crash/analytics data (if enabled) may be retained by Firebase for operational and product improvement purposes according to their retention policies.
- If you delete content or your account, we will delete or anonymize associated data within a reasonable period, subject to legal obligations, dispute resolution, or technical limitations of backups.

## 8. Your Choices and Rights
- You can add, edit, or delete your links and collections within the App.
- You can request deletion of your account; account deletion removes associated personal data from our active systems within a reasonable period (subject to legal/backup constraints).
- Where applicable by law, you may have rights to access, correct, port, or restrict processing of your personal data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or as defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## 10. International Data Transfers
Your data may be processed and stored on servers outside your country of residence (including in the United States) by our service providers (e.g., Firebase). We rely on appropriate safeguards for such transfers as required by applicable law.

## 11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date indicates the latest revisions. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice in the App or via other means.
