            <p><strong>Your privacy matters to us.</strong> This policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your data when using LinksVault.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how LinksVault ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our mobile or web applications, services, and associated websites (collectively, the "Service").</p>

        <h2>Affiliations & Trademarks</h2>
        <p>LinksVault is an independent application and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any of the social media platforms displayed within the app, including but not limited to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter/X, Reddit, Snapchat, or any other platforms.</p>

        <h2>3. Metadata Fetching</h2>

            <li>This metadata retrieval is performed using industry-standard methods and respects website policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Industry Standard Practice</h3>
            <p>This metadata retrieval uses the same methods as WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Telegram, and all major messaging and productivity apps. We use:</p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

        <h2>11. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
        <p>Despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>12. Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their policies.</p>

        <h2>13. Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, providing additional notice.</p>
